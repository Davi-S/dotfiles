# Battery Notify
# ==============
# Depends on `fetch-battery-info`
#
# This is a script to send desktop notifications about the battery status.
#
# Usage:
#   $1: Notification timeout multiplyer (default to 1 second notifications)
#
# Behavior:
#   - Sends a critical notification if the battery level is below 15%.
#   - Sends a low battery notification if the battery level is below 30%.
#   - Sends a normal notification for other battery levels.
#   - Sends a charging notification if the battery is charging.

# Source the fetch-battery-info script
source "$(dirname "$0")/fetch-battery-info"

# Call the function and capture its output
read LEVEL CHARGING REMAINING_TIME < <(fetch_battery_info)

# Notification settings
MULTIPLIER=${1:-1}  # Default multiplier is 1
NORMAL_TIMEOUT=$((1000 * MULTIPLIER))
CRITICAL_TIMEOUT=$((1000000 * MULTIPLIER))

# Send notifications based on battery level and charging status
if [[ "$CHARGING" != "Charging" ]]; then
    if [[ "$LEVEL" -lt 15 ]]; then
        notify-send -u critical -t $CRITICAL_TIMEOUT "Battery Critical" "Battery is at $LEVEL% ($REMAINING_TIME remaining). Connect the charger!"
    elif [[ "$LEVEL" -lt 30 ]]; then
        notify-send -t $NORMAL_TIMEOUT "Battery Low" "Battery is at $LEVEL% ($REMAINING_TIME remaining)."
    else
        notify-send -t $NORMAL_TIMEOUT "Battery Status" "Battery is at $LEVEL% ($REMAINING_TIME remaining)."
    fi
else
    notify-send -t $NORMAL_TIMEOUT "Battery Status" "Battery is at $LEVEL% (Charging)."
