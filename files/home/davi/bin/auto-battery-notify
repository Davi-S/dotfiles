# Auto Battery Notify
# ======================
# Depends on `fetch-battery-info`
# 
# This is a wrapper script for `battery-notify`. It calls `battery-notify` only 
# for some battery percentages and prevents duplicate notifications for the same
# battery percentage.
#
# Usage:
#   $1: Notification timeout multiplier passed to `battery-notify` 
#
# Behavior:
#   - Sends notifications only when the battery level is a multiple of 10 (e.g., 100%, 90%, 80%, ...).
#   - Sends notifications when the battery level is a multiple of 5 and below 20% (e.g., 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%).
#   - Prevents duplicate notifications for the same battery percentage by storing the last notified
#     percentage in a state file (~/.local/share/auto-battery-notify-state).


# Source the fetch-battery-info script
source "$(dirname "$0")/fetch-battery-info"

# Call the function and capture its output
read LEVEL CHARGING REMAINING_TIME < <(fetch_battery_info)

# Path to the state file
STATE_DIR="$HOME/.local/share"
STATE_FILE="$STATE_DIR/auto-battery-notify-state.txt"

# Ensure the state directory exists
mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR"

# Check if the battery level is a multiple of 10
is_multiple_of_10() {
    [[ $((LEVEL % 10)) -eq 0 ]]
}

# Check if the battery level is a multiple of 5 and below 20%
is_multiple_of_5_below_20() {
    [[ $((LEVEL % 5)) -eq 0 && $LEVEL -le 20 ]]
}

# Read the last notified battery percentage from the state file
LAST_NOTIFIED_PERCENT=0
if [[ -f "$STATE_FILE" ]]; then
    LAST_NOTIFIED_PERCENT=$(cat "$STATE_FILE")
fi

# Call the original battery-notify script if conditions are met and the percentage has changed
if (is_multiple_of_10 || is_multiple_of_5_below_20) && [[ "$LEVEL" -ne "$LAST_NOTIFIED_PERCENT" ]]; then
    battery-notify "$1"
    # Update the state file with the current battery percentage
    echo "$LEVEL" > "$STATE_FILE"
fi
